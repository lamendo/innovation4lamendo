continuous innovation through open crowd sourcing

# objective of this project
Building a network infrastructure, in which anonymous communication is standard. This provides the environment for each individual to provide powerfull and unconventional ideas. That network infrastructure can be used in any surrounding with specific purposes. E.g. in open innovation competitions as well in any organisation to foster creativity and innovation. Users can interact with each other by working on different ideas and bringing valuable input. Shortly: An app, which works like YikYak.
Creativity is shy. Thats why we want to eliminate everything, which prevents ideas from growing.
